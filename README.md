# BIOL439_HonorsProj
This project is my honors option for Biol 439: Practical Bioinformatics taught by Dr. Emily Davenport. In this analysis I combined a series of bioinformatic technqiues acquired throughout my time in this course. This analysis integrates data from the research lab I currently do research in outstide of the classroom at PSU, skills in bioinformatics, and R skills that I have learned from my coursework. The biological and coding details are explained at length in the markdown under each code chunk.
